The Utah NeuroRobotics Lab is working with the Neilsen Rehabilitation center to design an adaptive bowel care device for people with spinal cord injuries (SCI).
The goal of the project is to enable people with SCI to gain independence in the home by creating a device that will allow them to do a  bowel care regiment by themselves.
